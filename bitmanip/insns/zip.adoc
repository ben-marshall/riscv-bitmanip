[#insns-zip,reftext="Bit interleave"]
=== zip

Synopsis::
Gather odd and even bits of the source word into upper/lower halves of the
destination.

Mnemonic::
zip _rd_, _rs_

{reg:[
{bits: 2, name: 0x3},
{bits: 5, name: 0x4},
{bits: 5, name: 'rd'},
{bits: 3, name: 0x1},
{bits: 5, name: 'rs1'},
{bits: 5, name: 0x1e},
{bits: 7, name: 0x4},

Description:: 
This instruction scatters all of the odd and even bits of a source word into
the high and low halves of a destination word.
It is the inverse of the <<insns-unzip,unzip>> instruction.
This instruction is available only on RV32.

NOTE: This instruction is a specific encoding of a more generic instruction
which was originally proposed as part of the RISC-V Bitmanip extension
(`shfli`). Eventually, the more generic instruction may be standardised.
Until then, only the most common instances of it, such as this, are
being included in specifications.

Operation::
[source,sail]
--
foreach (i from 0 to xlen/2-1) {
  X(rd)[2*i] = X(rs1)[i]
  X(rd)[2*i+1] = X(rs1)[i+xlen/2]
}
--

.Software Hint
[NOTE, caption="SH" ]
===============================================================
This instruction is useful for implementing the SHA3 cryptographic
hash function on a 32-bit architecture, as it implements the
bit-interleaving operation used to speed up the 64-bit rotations
directly.
