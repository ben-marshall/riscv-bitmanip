Description:: 
This instructions counts the number of 1's (i.e., set bits) in the source register.

Operation::
[source,sail]
--
let bitcount = 0;
let rs = X(rs);

foreach (i from 0 to (xlen - 1) in inc)
    if rs[i] == 0b1 then bitcount = bitcount + 1 else ();

X[rd] = bitcount
--

===============================================================
This operations is known as population count, popcount, sideways sum, bit summation, or Hamming weight.

The GCC builtin function `+__builtin_popcount (unsigned int x)+` is implemented by cpop on RV32 and by *cpopw* on RV64.
The GCC builtin function `+__builtin_popcountl (unsigned long x)+` for LP64 is implemented by *cpop* on RV64.
