Description::
This instruction returns the larger of two signed integers.

Operation::
[source,sail]
--
let rs1_val = X(rs1);
let rs2_val = X(rs2);

let result = if   rs1_val <_s rs2_val
    	     then rs2_val
	     else rs1_val;

X(rd) = result;
--

.Software Hint
[NOTE, caption="SW"]
===============================================================
Calculating the absolute value of a signed integer can be performed
using the following sequence: *neg rD,rS* followed by *max
rD,rS,rD*. When using this common sequence, it is suggested that they
are scheduled with no intervening instructions so that
implementations that are so optimized can fuse them together.
